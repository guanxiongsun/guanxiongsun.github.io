In *CinC*, 2016<br>
*We present an end-to-end framework to estimate the left ventricular (LV) volume from 3D echocardiography data. Specifically, we introduce a novel unsupervised learning method to train a CNN for feature extraction. Then, the random forests method is used to predicts the LV volume.*"
